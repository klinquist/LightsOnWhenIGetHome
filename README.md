My first SmartApp for SmartThings (http://www.smartthings.com)

This SmartApp will turn on lights in your home (you will need ZWave or other SmartThings-compatible switches) when your garage door opens (you will need a SmartThings compatible contact sensor)  *if*  it is between Sunset and Sunrise.

You will also need a WUnderground API key.  It's free:  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/pricing.html
